# 8-Puzzle
This project is to solve the 8-Puzzle problem using different algorithms and heuristics functions. The project was tested out on numerous problems with varying depth, and I made a comparison between the different results from different algorithms and heuristics. 

# Project Files
The _.txt_ files in part 2 and 3 are Puzzle samples, while the files with algorithms names and "output" refer to the result from the running the algorithm and saving the steps to solve the problems - if the solution is approachable.  

# Sample Output 
The algorithms print results sarting from root, and step by step, till the solution is found.
